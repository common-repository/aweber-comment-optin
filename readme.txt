This plugin allows you to insert a checkbox at the end of your comment forms so your viewers can double optin to a Aweber list of your choosing.

== Description ==

**Note: This plugin is no longer being maintained or supported. Download and use at your own risk.**

Never miss another potential lead again. With this plugin, you now have the ability to add a simple checkbox and message to the end of your comment forms to allow your users to subscribe to a Aweber list when commenting.

The plugin integrates seamlessly with the Aweber API to register the email (and optionally name) of your commenters into an email list of your choosing. By using the double optin method for capturing these email addresses, you can rest assured you are getting the best qualified leads for your growing email list.
